This is the GUI presented today. 
It is written using qt5,
which may need to be installed on your devices for the program to work properly.
It is adviced to use Qtcreator which is powerful IDE for developing qt projects,
since it handels the otherwise quite annoying process of compiling and linking. 

If this README file causes problems during compilation (although i tested it
and it worked properly) feel free to remove it. 

As you can see theres a lack of comments in the Code. Im going to fix this over the 
weekend, but its presumably a good idea, and would be appreciated, for those who are
trying to understand the code to write comments too wherever necessary.

Version 0 
(Since i dont know the proper way of version numbering :D )
